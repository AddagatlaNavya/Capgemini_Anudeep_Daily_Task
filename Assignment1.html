			<p> <b> Coffee </b> is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from 
			certain <i>Coffea</i> species. The genus Coffea is native to tropical Africa (specifically having 
			its origin in Ethiopia and Sudan) and Madagascar, the Comoros, Mauritius, and RÃ©union 
			in the Indian Ocean. Dried coffee seeds (referred to as <q>beans</q>) are roasted to varying 
			degrees, depending on the desired flavor. Roasted beans are ground and then brewed 
			with near-boiling water to produce the beverage known as coffee.
